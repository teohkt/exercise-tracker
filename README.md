# Exercise Tracker
This project was was built with assistance from a MERN stack tutorial by Beau Carnes. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node. MongoDB is a NoSQL database which can be controlled with Node.js. Express is a flexible Node.js web framework that helps move content from the backend to the front. React is framework that will be used to manage components and states in the front end.

# Setup
To create a new react app, we used 
>$ npx create-react-app app_name

This will create a new folder with the specified name of 'app_name'. This folder will be created in the location that the terminal currently displays.

The backend portion was completed first, and developed within a new backend folder put into the react-app. For the node packages, express, cors, mongoose, and dotenv were used.
`````
npm init -y
npm install express cors mongoose dotenv
``````
Express is the web framework that was used for Node. CORS stands for cross-origin resource sharing. It is an Express middleware that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from a separate domain. Mongoose is a middleware that makes it easier to control MongoDB. dotenv is the package that allows for the use of environment variables.
